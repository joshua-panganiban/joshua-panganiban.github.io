                <div class="about-paragraph">
                    <p>
                        Hi, I'm Joshua — thank you for visiting my page!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I'm a researcher and engineer with a passion for developing and applying computational methods to solve complex, real-world problems. Solution-oriented and versatile, I enjoy drawing on a wide range of tools and disciplines to tackle multidisciplinary challenges.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Currently, I work as a Research Engineer at <a href="https://www.takeuchi-const.co.jp/en/" target="_blank"> <u>Takeuchi Construction, Inc.</u></a>, where I am involved in developing the company's patented construction technologies in seismic base isolation and ground improvement. I primarily lead two projects: (1) The development of a particle-based modeling scheme in simulating the vibration reduction performance of sandbags; and (2) the development of a neural network-enhanced topology optimization framework for foundation systems. These projects aim to deliver more cost-effective and resilient solutions for earthquake-prone areas.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Outside of work, I collaborate with my former lab — the <a href="https://www.eri.u-tokyo.ac.jp/cshpc/index_en.html" target="_blank"> <u>Computational Science and High-Performance Computing Laboratory</u></a> at the Earthquake Research Institute, The University of Tokyo — on an independent research initiative. We're developing a data-driven, <a href="https://doi.org/10.5610/jaee.25.4_164" target="_blank"><u>HPC-enhanced agent-based economic simulator</u></a> capable of efficiently simulating large economies at a 1:1 scale. While the framework has broad applications, our primary focus is on estimating the economic impacts of disasters, with the goal of informing policies that accelerate post-disaster recovery.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In 2022, I worked as a research fellow with the <a href="https://emi-megacities.org/" target="_blank"><u>Earthquakes and Megacities Initiative (EMI)</u></a>, collaborating with an international team of researchers, engineers, policymakers, and disaster management professionals on the Climate and Disaster Risk Assessment (CDRA) for Quezon City, Philippines. My primary role focused on the computational analysis of shelter needs and evacuation planning citywide, contributing to the development of the Roadmap and Tools for Managing Complex Emergencies—a key component of the city's disaster preparedness strategy.
                    </p>
                    <p>                
                        Regarding my industry experience, I previously worked as a Structural Engineer at the Manila office of <a href="https://www.jgc.com/en/" target="_blank"><u>JGC Holdings Corporation</u></a> from 2019 to 2021, where I focused on the analysis and design of oil and gas facilities, as well as the development of structural design and automation tools. I am also a licensed Civil Engineer and Master Plumber in the Philippines. Between 2018 and 2021, I occasionally took on freelance projects involving the design of residential houses and the preparation of building plans and permit documents.
